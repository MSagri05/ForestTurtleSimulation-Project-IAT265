# Forest Turtle Simulation 

This is a project I created for my **IAT 265: Multimedia Programming for Art and Design** course at Simon Fraser University.  
(Summer 2025 â€“ ongoing)

For our very first project in this class, we were asked to create a simulation using Java and Processing. I decided to build a forest simulation where a turtle wanders around, looking for food.

The turtle moves naturally using vector math and animation. When a mushroom (food) appears, the turtle turns and walks toward it. Once it eats the mushroom, a new one spawns after a short delay.

This project helped me learn about:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- 2D animation and graphics
- Using PVectors for realistic movement
- Timers and collision logic

More features and polish are still in progress!
